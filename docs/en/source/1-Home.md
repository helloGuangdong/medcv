### Guiding principles

- Modularity. A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, 
fully-configurable modules that can be plugged together with as little restrictions as possible. 
- Minimalism. Each module should be kept short and simple. 
Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. 
- Easy extensibility. New modules are dead simple to add (as new classes and functions), 
and existing modules provide ample examples. 
To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making radiomics suitable for advanced research.
- Work with Python. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. 
Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.
