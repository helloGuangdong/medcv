# MedCV: OpenCV for Medical

## You have just found MedCV 
MedCV is an advanced medical image visualization library, which is written by [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) to complete image visualization. MedCV was born to solve the compatibility between OpenCV and medical images. It would help you to quickly visualize your results. 

If you have the following requirements, please choose MedCV:

- Simple and fast medical visualization design (MedCV is highly modular, minimalist, and expandable)
- Establish a medical image interactive platform


## Guiding principles

- **Friendly**. MedCV is an API designed for humans. MedCV follows best practices for reducing cognitive difficulties: MedCV provides a consistent and concise API to quickly complete visualization tasks.
- **Modularity**. MedCV has three independent modules: visualize, tools, and GUI controls. You can use them to customize your own visualization operations or build an interactive platform. 
- **Work with Python**. No separate configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.
